# TopologicalPlaneGraphs

Summary of main goals:

Writing a program that will be given a topological structure of a planar graph and will have to create a geometrical embedding into a plane and draw it. For that I will have to implement a routing algorithm that will create new paths between vertices.

Platforms and background:
* Python 3 with libraries TkInter and pyhull
* Knowledge required: graph topology, computational geometry, data structures, coding in Python
